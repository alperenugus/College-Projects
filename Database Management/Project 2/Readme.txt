Challenges: In question 8, at first I could not understand how to find a string that does not start with a specific letter. Then, I searched for it in the lecture slides and remembered the NOT LIKE operator from the examples.

Likes / Dislikes: Actually, the assignment covers all the operators and logic that we have seen in the lectures therefore, I think it is a good one.

How long: 
Approximately 1.5 hours.
