Challenges: In step 6, I thought that I should directly crete a 
table named as books directly using books1 and books2 tables but
it was not the case. First I should have created the table, then 
insert the data from the other ones into it.

Likes / Dislikes: It is a well prepared assignment to exercise
many operations with sql.

How long: 
Approximately 2 hours.
