Why is BigDecimal better than double for representing dollar amounts?

=> BigDecimal is a type of number representations in computers. When we use doubles in our programs, 
if the number is too big or too small, since the double type has a certain precision, there can be computation
errors. In order to prevent these, we should use BigDecimal type while dealing with money. The disadvantage 
is that since the math operators are not overloaded for BigDecimal, the implementation can be more time consuming.

List 3 good practices related to exception handling:

=> Exceptions prevent programs to be error prone.
=> Using exceptions will eradicate errors stemming from the users.
=> Using proper handling mechanisms, exceptions are the way to maintain a program continuously.
